  	<h1>About the Awards</h1>
	
	<p>The 2012 UDI Awards for Excellence recognize the outstanding contributions made by leaders in the urban development industry to the built environment in British Columbia.  The Awards are the premier, and highest profile, form of peer to peer recognition of completed development projects in the Lower Mainland, the Okanagan and on Vancouver Island.</p>
	
	<p>From ‘Best Single Family’ development to Best ‘High Rise’ development, ‘Best Commercial and Retail’ development to ‘Best Industrial’ development, UDI will this year also be awarding the ‘Visionary Award’ and the ‘Most Sustainable Award’.  Another exciting award will include the Vancouver Sun Readers Choice Award where a shortlist of entries, selected and promoted by the Sun, will be voted on by the reading public through the use of social media.  </p>
	
	<p>To celebrate UDI’s 40th Anniversary and the members that have made this organization great, it is important to recognize the past as well as the future.  The UDI Board of Directors will be awarding a special ‘Hall of Fame’ award to honour exceptional individuals for their contribution to UDI, the industry and the community.</p>
	
	<p>The Institute’s values and principles are the standards against which all projects are measured.  We respect the natural environment, we create the built environment, and we foster vibrant communities, recognizing that the impact of our developments will last for generations.</p>
	
	<p>We strive to create a wider understanding of sound land use and development principles and practices.  We value heritage, the power of a place to grow in significance over time.  We salute development which recognizes economic stability in the larger framework of sustaining the human environment.</p>
	
	<p>These Awards celebrate the outstanding contribution of developers who had the vision to take our cities, and the people who live and work in them, into the future.</p>
